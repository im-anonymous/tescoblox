Shift Information

The host will be supervising all staff — you are to note down usernames of staff that acted professionally, and mature and then send the usernames to a member of the SMT team. All shifts should be 40 minutes long. If the attendance is poor, you may end the shift earlier than planned. 

Please make sure that staff in-game are using **grammar,** and helping people well. Make sure that staff are not causing any arguments, and monitor the game for possible exploiters/glitchers/trollers. 

After the shift ends, please take the attendance of staff. You may either bring them to the staff area using the :n command, or do a screenshot of the leaderboard. Attendance proof must be sent to a SMT member.

Please announce the conclusion of shift in-game, but also on the group & discord server. You can use the format below:

/session shift



Promotional Shift Information

The promotional shift may be from now on hosted by the ranks above Employment Assistant, hosting a promotional shift is not hard, however it is slightly different from the regular one. When the shift starts, announce it in the discord server using the /session shift command, HOWEVER when the announcement is posted, add a note saying it’s a promotional one below.

You need to announce the shift in-game as well, do so using the :n command. Please announce it only once, and call all staff into the briefing room.

When called, assign them to positions (i.e. patrol, selfcheck-out, etc.). You may then dismiss them, and supervise all of the staff members.

Max 4 promotions for Trainee Staff Members,
Max 4 promotions for Junior Staff Members
Max 2 promotions for Senior Staff Members

Additionally (with a permission from Chief Staff Officer+), you may promote 1 Management Team member.
